## Service Overview

ZSoftly's DevOps services help mid-market companies implement enterprise-grade DevOps practices to improve software delivery, infrastructure management, and operational efficiency. We bridge the gap between development and operations teams, enabling faster innovation while maintaining system stability and security.

We offer technology-agnostic DevOps solutions, working with both AWS-native tools and popular open source/SaaS platforms. Our expertise spans the entire DevOps toolchain, from continuous integration with Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions to GitOps deployment with ArgoCD. We help clients select and implement the right tools for their specific needs, whether they prefer AWS-managed services or open source alternatives.

As a complete CI/CD as a Service provider, we can host, manage, and maintain your runners and build infrastructure, eliminating the need for you to worry about scaling, maintaining, or managing your CI/CD environments. This fully managed approach allows your development teams to focus on building great software while we ensure your delivery pipeline is always available, secure, and optimized.
