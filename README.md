# ZSoftly Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for ZSoftly services, deployed using GitHub Pages with MkDocs Material theme.

## About This Repository

This repository houses Markdown documentation for ZSoftly's service portfolio. The documentation is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages using a CI/CD pipeline implemented with GitHub Actions.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The documentation site is built and deployed using a multi-stage GitHub Actions workflow:

- **Trigger**: Automatically on push to the `main` branch or manually via workflow dispatch
- **Build**: First job that builds the documentation using MkDocs with the Material theme
- **Prepare**: Second job that prepares the deployment and creates a staging environment
- **Deploy**: Final job with manual approval requirement for deploying to GitHub Pages
- **Features**: Dark/light theme switching, responsive design, search functionality

The deployment process requires manual approval through GitHub's environment protection feature, giving you control over when documentation is published to production.
